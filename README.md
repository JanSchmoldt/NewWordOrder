# NewWordOrder
 Program to make a visual representation of the distribution of new words in a given text
 
 The program reads in a text file that needs to be specified in the main file (NewWordOrder.py) as "infile".
 As a result the program creates a line graph in which for each word in the given text, the current percentage of new words up to this word is displayed.
 The caracteristics of the created line is an indicator about how challanging the text is for a reader who is not familiar with the language of the given text. The closer the line is to 100%, the higher is the number of new word. And the higher the number of words, the more often the reader may have to refer to a dictionary.
 Punctuation is removed from the text before calculating the number of new words.
 
 As as example file the two txt files sample.txt and Die_Glocke.txt are added here.
